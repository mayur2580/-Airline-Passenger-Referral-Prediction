# Project Description: 
## Business Context 
In the dynamic and highly competitive airline industry, companies like IndiGo are continuously 
striving to enhance customer experience and build lasting loyalty. A critical component of this 
effort is understanding and predicting passenger referrals, which can significantly influence the 
airline's market position and reputation. The analysis of passenger reviews from 2006 to 2019 
offers IndiGo a comprehensive view into the various facets of the travel experience as perceived 
by their customers. These reviews provide invaluable feedback on service quality, including 
comfort, service, and overall value, and play a key role in shaping potential customers' 
perceptions. 
By leveraging this extensive dataset, IndiGo aims to develop a predictive model to identify which 
passengers are most likely to recommend the airline to others. This insight enables IndiGo to: 

1. Enhance Customer Experience: 
By pinpointing the factors that most influence positive referrals, IndiGo can focus on improving 
these aspects of their service, ensuring that they meet or exceed customer expectations. 

2. Targeted Improvements: 
The ability to predict referrals allows IndiGo to address specific areas needing improvement, 
whether it be in-flight comfort, customer service, or overall value for money. 

3. Strategic Marketing: 
Understanding referral patterns can help IndiGo tailor their marketing strategies to leverage 
positive word-of-mouth and foster a strong brand reputation. 

4. Competitive Edge: 
By continuously refining their services based on customer feedback, IndiGo can differentiate 
itself from competitors and strengthen its position in the market.
